# GoogleQuest Competition

The intention of this project is to develop a model that will predict target values of 30 different question-answer labels. The question-answer subjects for training and testing were gathered from nearly 70 different StackExchange websites. More details can be found at Kaggle's competition website: https://www.kaggle.com/c/google-quest-challenge/overview

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

What packages users need to install. The following is an example:

```
import keras
from keras.layers import LSTM
```

## Built With

For the moment, I've just list the packages and libraries that we may eventually use in python.

* [Keras](https://pypi.org/project/Keras/) - Not sure if we will use this. It uses Tensorflow in the backend
* [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/) - Little knowledge of this guy except that documention is really good
* [Tensorflow](https://www.tensorflow.org/)

## Planning

Please read [Planning.md](https://https://github.com/ezluna/hello-world/edit/master/Planning.md) for timeline and delivery

## Versioning

We can use [SemVer](http://semver.org/) for versioning. This is really good practice for version control. Please take a look.

* If we are ever inspired for the code of somenone else we should put it here 
* If we ever use the code of someone we should mention it here
* etc

## License

Do not think we will use this section, but who knows, Matt can create another precision optimiser (as for croissance :)...)
